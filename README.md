The following steps needed to be completed in order to finish this challenge:
Calculate the following:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

To solve this challenge, first I read the csv file by using the Python command and utilized functions like len(), sum(), next(), print(), among others to answer the questions. 
I also used loops and if statements for the logical aspect of the algorithm. 

For debugging, I used Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT, mostly for the part to calculate the greatest increase in profits (date and amount), but it finally worked out.
